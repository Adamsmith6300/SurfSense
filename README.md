## How to get started?

Before we begin, we need to set up our Neo4j Graph Database. This is where SurfSense stores all your saved information. For a quick setup, I suggest getting your free Neo4j Aura DB from [https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/) or setting it up locally.

After obtaining your Neo4j credentials, make sure to get your OpenAI API Key from [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/).

1. Register Your SurfSense account at https://www.surfsense.net/signup
2. Download SurfSense Extension from https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/surfsense/jihmihbdpfjhppdlifphccgefjhifblf

Now you are ready to use SurfSense. Start by first logging into the Extension.

When you start the extension you should see a Login page like this

![extension login](https://i.ibb.co/qkkR5Lt/extlogin.png)



After logging in you will need to fill your Neo4j Credentials & OpenAPI Key.

![settings](https://i.ibb.co/j5PT171/extreqvalues.png)



After Saving you should be able to use extension now.

#### GENERAL
As an example lets visit : https://myanimelist.net/anime/season (Summer 2024 Anime atm) and save it to SurfSense.

Now lets ask SurfSense "Give list of summer 2024 animes with images."

Sample Response:

### Local Setup Guide

#### Backend

For authentication purposes, you‚Äôll also need a PostgreSQL instance running on your machine.

Now lets setup the SurfSense BackEnd
1. Clone this repo.
2. Go to ./backend subdirectory.
3. Setup Python Virtual Enviroment
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required dependencies.
5. Update the required Environment variables in envs.py
 
|ENV VARIABLE|Description  |
|--|--|
| POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL | postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@host:5432/database|
| API_SECRET_KEY | Can be any Random String value. Make Sure to remember it for as you need to send it in request to Backend for security purposes.|


6. Backend is a FastAPI Backend so now just run the server on unicorn using command `uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
7. If everything worked fine you should see screen like this.

![backend](https://i.ibb.co/542Vhqw/backendrunning.png)

---

#### Extension

After Setting up the BackEnd Lets do a quick build of the extension.

1. Go to ./extension subdirectory.
2. Run `pnpm i` to install required dependencies.
3. Update Env variables at `./src/env.tsx`

|ENV VARIABLE|DESCRIPTION|
|--|--|
| API_SECRET_KEY | Same String value your set for Backend |
| BACKEND_URL | Give hosted backend url here. Eg. `http://127.0.0.1:8000`|

4. Run `pnpm run build` to build your extension. Build will be generated in `./dist` folder
5. Enable Developer Mode in Chrome and load the extinction from `./dist` folder.
6. Extension will load successfully.

Now resister a quick user through Swagger API > Try it Out: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/default/register_user_register_post

Make Sure in request body `"apisecretkey"` value is same value as `API_SECRET_KEY` we been assigning.

---

#### FrontEnd

For local frontend setup just fill out the `.env` file of frontend.

|ENV VARIABLE|DESCRIPTION|
|--|--|
| NEXT_PUBLIC_API_SECRET_KEY | Same String value your set for Backend & Extension |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL | Give hosted backend url here. Eg. `http://127.0.0.1:8000`|
| NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY | Google Recaptcha v2 Client Key |
| RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY | Google Recaptcha v2 Server Key|

and run it using `pnpm run dev`

You should see your Next.js frontend running at `localhost:3000`

##  Tech Stack

 - **Extenstion** : Chrome Manifest v3
 - **BackEnd** : FastAPI with LangChain
 - **FrontEnd**: Next.js with Aceternity.

#### Architecture:
In Progress...........

## Future Work
- Generalize the way SurfSense uses Graphs. Will soon make an integration with FalkorDB soon.
- Saving Chats
- Basic keyword search page for saved sessions **[Done]**
- Multi & Single Document Chat **[Done]**
- Implement some tricks from GraphRAG papers to optimize current GraphRAG logic. 

## Contribute 

Contributions are very welcome! A contribution can be as small as a ‚≠ê or even finding and creating issues.
Fine-tuning the Backend is always desired.
