# SurfSense
While tools like NotebookLM and Perplexity are impressive and highly effective for conducting research on any topic, imagine having both at your disposal with complete privacy control. That's exactly what SurfSense offers. With SurfSense, you can create your own knowledge base for research, similar to NotebookLM, or easily research the web just like Perplexity. SurfSense also includes an effective cross-browser extension to directly save dynamic content bookmarks, such as social media chats, calendar invites, important emails, tutorials, recipes, and more to your SurfSense knowledge base. Now, you‚Äôll never forget anything and can easily research everything.
