# SurfSense

Well when I‚Äôm browsing the internet, I tend to save a ton of content‚Äîbut remembering when and what you saved? Total brain freeze! That‚Äôs where SurfSense comes in. SurfSense is a Personal AI Assistant for anything you see (Social Media Chats, Calender Invites, Important Mails, Tutorials, Recipies and anything ) on the World Wide Web. Now, you‚Äôll never forget any browsing session. Easily capture your web browsing session and desired webpage content using an easy-to-use cross browser extension. Then, ask your personal knowledge base anything about your saved content, and voil√†‚Äîinstant recall!

## How to get started?
**UPDATE 20 SEPTEMBER 2024:** 

 - SurfSense now works on Hierarchical Indices.
 - Knowledge Graph dependency is removed for now until I find some better Graph RAG solutions.
 - Added support for Local LLMs

Until I find a good host for my backend you need to setup SurfSense locally for now. 

### Backend

For authentication purposes, you‚Äôll also need a PostgreSQL instance running on your machine.

Now lets setup the SurfSense BackEnd
1. Clone this repo.
2. Go to ./backend subdirectory.
3. Setup Python Virtual Environment
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required dependencies.
5. Update/Make the required Environment variables in .env
 
|ENV VARIABLE|Description  |
|--|--|
| IS_LOCAL_SETUP | 'true' for Ollama mistral-nemo or 'false' from OpenAI gpt-4o-mini|
| POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL | postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@host:5432/database|
| API_SECRET_KEY | Can be any Random String value. Make Sure to remember it for as you need to send it in user registration request to Backend for security purposes.|


6. Backend is a FastAPI Backend so now just run the server on unicorn using command `uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
7. If everything worked fine you should see screen like this.

### FrontEnd

For local frontend setup just fill out the `.env` file of frontend.

|ENV VARIABLE|DESCRIPTION|
|--|--|
| NEXT_PUBLIC_API_SECRET_KEY | Same String value your set for Backend |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL | Give hosted backend url here. Eg. `http://127.0.0.1:8000`|
| NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY | Google Recaptcha v2 Client Key |
| RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY | Google Recaptcha v2 Server Key|

and run it using `pnpm run dev`

You should see your Next.js frontend running at `localhost:3000`

**Make sure to register an account from frontend so you can login to extension.**

---

### Extension

Extension is in plasmo framework which is a cross browser extension framework.

For building extension just fill out the `.env` file of frontend.

|ENV VARIABLE|DESCRIPTION|
|--|--|
| PLASMO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL| SurfSense Backend URL eg. "http://127.0.0.1:8000" |

Build the extension for your favorite browser using this guide: https://docs.plasmo.com/framework/workflows/build#with-a-specific-target 

When you load and start the extension you should see a Login page like this

![extension login](https://i.ibb.co/qkkR5Lt/extlogin.png)



After logging in you will need to fill your OpenAPI Key. Fill random value if you are using Ollama.


![ext-settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49d8aa30-0ae1-4065-b504-e7e84dfb0d19)


After Saving you should be able to use extension now.

|Options|Explanations|
|--|--|
| Search Space | Think of it like a category tag for the webpages you want to save.  |
| Clear Inactive History Sessions | It clears the saved content for Inactive Tab Sessions.  |
| Save Current Webpage Snapshot | Stores the current webpage session info into SurfSense history store|
| Save to SurfSense | Processes the SurfSense History Store & Initiates a Save Job |

4. Now just start browsing the Internet. Whatever you want to save any content take its Snapshot and save it to SurfSense. After Save Job is completed you are ready to ask anything about it to SurfSense üß†.

6. Now go to SurfSense Dashboard After Logging in.

|DASHBOARD OPTIONS|DESCRIPTION|
|--|--|
| Playground | See saved documents and can have chat with multiple docs. |
| Search Space Chat | Used for questions about your content in particular search space.|
| Saved Chats | All your saved chats.|
| Settings | If you want to update your Open API key.|

### Docker Support
Afer setting SurfSense-Frontend/.env and backend/.env run `docker-compose build --no-cache`. After building image run `docker-compose up -d`
